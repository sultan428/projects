    "## Dota Moba Game \n",
    "Dota stands for (Defence of the antiants) and Moba game type means (Multiplayer online battle arena). dota is a very famos game that have a huge community, multiple sponser companies and profesional teams. Dota have almost 10 million active users with fans websites and blogs, the game was released in 2003. the game matches contains two teams that can choose between 113 hero and each heroes have three main types (Agility, Strength, intelegance) and attack types (melee, range) along with roles in the match its self such as support and inetiator. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statnemnt\n",
    "for the problem statnment, is to predict the winning team from match information and hero picks in the start of the match, becouse there is alot tournaments and championships that have very high prizes. and also to recomend dota that some pre game features may highly affect match output and the dota company may improve thir match making by balancing the features that affect the output. Moreover becouse each heroes have multiple types and attack types, recomending winning combinations that most frequently win matches could be a great insight for proffecianal players.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audiance:\n",
    "    1- Dota developers\n",
    "    2- proffecinal teams and players\n",
    "    3- sponsers and fans\n",

    "##### Data Description\n",
    "the data sets are public player matches joined with matches and also joined with heroes table to gain the heros used for each team player in each match id in a SQL query. then downloaded as a csv file and loaded from the jupyter note book, dataset retrieved has 200 thousend observation describing 20 thousend match and having 22 columns. the target data is the radiant win column and columns primary attributes and attack type that describes the heros types can extract from them the most winning combination like if the team choise two strength and three intellegant types heros.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Query used:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM public_player_matches p INNER JOIN public_matches m ON p.match_id = m.match_id\n",

    "## Data munging:\n",
    "data is cleaned by removing nulls checking for types, duplicates and dropping columns tha only inclouds nulls such as num_rank_tier\tand cluster. secondly describe the dataframe to check the average, min and max looking also for outliers presence and there is. thirdly splitting a column that describe the role of the hero in the match, because each hero may have more than one role but its stored as list soo its splitted into two columns having two roles. only two becouse the third and fourth roles mostly are nulls, but in the second role there was about 2000 missing rows tha got imputed by filling it with the column mode. lastly there is two columns lobby type and game mode that had some meaningless integres that ware just the foriegn keys to other tables, so after checking thier meaning. they got mapped to their original meanings in two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "done by first checking the target variable if it has imbalenced values that could affect modeling and fortianatly the values are balanced. secondly plotting the distribution of average mmr(Rank) and match duration to check if the have a normal distribution or that they are skewed and the column rank was normaly distributed and the duration ware right skewed due to outliers that needed to be dealt with. thirdly visualizing the categorical columns value counts using bar charts to visualise their frequency. Using box plot to visualise the outliers in the columns duration average rank and the number of ranked players, then removed the outliers in them by subsetting the data frame with out the values that ware 3 standered diviated from the mean. then plotting a corrolation heat map to visualise the target relationship with other columns, and relationship was weak with other columns. after checking the relationships did a pairplot on the numirical columns to visualise the scatter plots between each column looking for linarity. Lastly for hero column, plotted a barchart that displays the 10 most frequent picked heros in matches. Moreover subseteing the dataframe to only include the winning choices and then plotted a barchart for it to visualise the most frequent winning choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "as the data target variable is radiant win so there is no feature that describe who is the radiant. by that i found the mappings of player slot and foundout that player slots that ware above 100 are the radiant and the less than 100 ware the dire (second team). a function was created to add a column describing weather it the observation ware in the radiant team or not based on the mapping. secondly becouse the start date ware stored in seconds it needed to be converted to a date and time object and extract the day of the week, hour of the day, month and the week number in a year to see if the times affect the players performance. Lastly and before the first approuch columns duration, match id, hero id and player slot ware dropped becouse for the duration column its collected after the match and our problem statement indicated that it must at the start of the match and for the other columns they ware dropped becouse they only represent id's and after grouping teams no need for player slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approuch 1\n",
    "becouse data is describing each match by 10 observation, it needed to be combined for each team taking 5 players num mmr and average mmr and the extraxted features wich are the same to all team player. and then for features that describes the types and attack types for heros ware summed togather giving diffrent combinations for the 5 rows. and\n",
    "assigning the whole team heros having an extra 5 columns to describe each player pick. the second step, team hero selection needed to be combined also better than the 5 columns becouse they made the models sensetive to the position of the pick rather than understanding them without any player position. by spreading all heros available to be on the column side and then assigning one's to the teams selections having for each observation 5 one's (choices) of heros. More over saving the dataframe as a csv file to be used in the modeling notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Approuch 2\n",
    "in the second approuch all the match observations that. ware 10, five for each team. the approuch is to combine them in 1 observation by taking the diffrence in hero types and attack types and adding a 10 columns describing their the match picks. using two functions, one to creat a hero selction for the whole match having 10 rows and the second function was for taking the diffrence and the columns that ware repeated such as match average mmr along with sacving the file as a csv to be used in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models and ensamble methods\n",
    "becouse its mainly a classification problem, the choicen models with gridsearch for best hyper parameters for both approuches to determin the best approuch and best resualts:\n",
    "\n",
    "       Models:\n",
    "       1- Decision tree\n",
    "       2- Logistic regression\n",
    "       3- Knearist nighbor\n",
    "       4- MLP Classifier\n",
    "       5- LinearSVC\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Ensamble:\n",
    "       1- Adabtive Boosting using the best performing model\n",
    "       2- Bagging also using best model\n",
    "       3- Random forest Classifeir\n",
    "       4- Extra Tree classifier\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation metrics\n",
    "evaluation metrics is based on the the training and testing accuracy resualts along with the cross val score mean, also evaluating the testing set scores on the baseline accuracy of each approuch. for the best perfoing models in the test set, a classificatio report is displayed showing diffrent metrics for the models such as F1 score. Lastly a confusion matrix is displayed also for the well performing models to visualise the correctly and incorrectly classified instences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "regarding the approuches used in this project, approuch 1 wich was each match combined into two observations that describe each team hero picks and taking the hero types and attack type total for each regardless of the hero pick position. approuch 1 performed in modeling and ensambling better than approuch two wich contains all match pick including hero pick postioning and taking the diffrence in each team for the total types and attack types. performed better by 1 percent for the best models in both approuches wich is also an improvment from the baseline, for the final model choice approuch one Boosted Logistic regression model that their parameters ware takien from a gridsearch. regarding the feature importance to determine the affecting variables, but only for approuch one that performed better the  features ware the Average rank and the hero type totals and the attack type totals. Lastly my openion on the match prediction is that its very hard to predict using the selction information and basic team information due to the dota match making well balanced and that match winning mainly lies oppuon players performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "for the second question wich was that is there a hero type and attack types combinations that mostly ones, turns out\n",
    "there is some combinations that have a high winning frequency and they are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- having 2 intelegant type heros and 2 strength based heros and one agility wich is the carry, along with having \n",
    "    a balanced attack combo of 2 range attackers and two melee.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2- having 2 intelegant type heros and 1 strength based hero and 2 agility wich is the carry, also having them as\n",
    "    three range attackers and 2 melee wich is also balanced\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3- having one intelegance hero and 2 strength and agility heros, like the first combination in the attack types \n",
    "    wich are having two range attackers and three melee attackers. making this pick attack type condition hard to\n",
    "    lose.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Set backs and challenges\n",
    "ware in the data colloction while the queiries reached its max limit run time wich was 1000 ms due to the multple joins and the number of observations drawn from the database. secondly in finding a greate approuch to combine the obbservation evaluating it per match. More over tunning the models sush as the MLP classifier and support vector machein classifier. also in trying at first to predict using all the match observation wich ware about 10 rows per match and the accuracy ware good but the reason behind it ware that the models mapped the resualts based simmilarties in the same match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future work\n",
    "is that after conclouding that hero combinations and basic match information at the start of the match is not enough to predict the winning team. for the future more data will be added that describes the personal information of each player and past matches data. then will combine the approuches done in this project to the additional data and try to predict the winning team. Moreover if the future approuch work an API will be created for fans and sponcers to predict and to get types recomendations from the insights."
